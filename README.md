## **Features**

## **Architecture**

The application follows the **VIPER architecture**, ensuring modularity and clean separation of responsibilities:

1. **View:**  
   - Handles UI display and user interactions.
   - Updates dynamically based on ViewState.

2. **ViewState:**  
   - Manages UI state and communicates with the Presenter.

3. **Interactor:**  
   - Contains business logic (e.g., tax calculations, currency conversion).
   - Interacts with services like `IncomeItemDataService` and `CurrencyConversionService`.

4. **Presenter:**  
   - Acts as a mediator between the ViewState and Interactor.
   - Processes data and updates the ViewState.

5. **Router:**  
   - Handles navigation between screens.

6. **Service Layer:**  
   - `IncomeItemDataService` manages local data storage in Realm.
   - `CurrencyConversionService` fetches real-time exchange rates.
